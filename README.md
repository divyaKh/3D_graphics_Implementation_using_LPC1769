# 3D_graphics_Implementation_using_LPC1769
In this project, a graphic display prototype is developed using LPC 1769 interfaced with a 1.8‚Äù ST7735R TFT LCD. The aim is to display a 3D shading model and diffuse reflection computation on LPC1769 microprocessor platform. The key in this project is create a basic 3D Graphics Processing Engine.
